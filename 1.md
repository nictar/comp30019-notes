## Computer Graphics and Interaction
Computer Graphics (CG):
- anything involved in the creation or manipulation of images on a computer, including animated images
- include computer games, CAD, VR, AR; forms the basis of all GUIs

Interaction:
- concerns the study of how humans use interactive computing systems
- important for applications of computer graphics that are used directly by humans
- includes GUIs, input mechanisms (e.g. touch), elements of human cognition (need to think about how humans think and use interfaces)

## Before vs After Computers
Before:
- Manual (by-hand) animation process
- Sensorama — immersive, multi-sensory machine

After:
- Moore's Law — animators have access to increasingly high-powered computers at cheaper cost
- 3D models became possible where objects could be placed into 3D space and made to interact with one another
- examples of application: medical surgery, Google Glass, gaming (Kinect sensor), tourism, shopping

Unity3D:
- powerful cross-platform 3D engine and a user-friendly development environment that enables users to easily create 3D games and apps
- easy enough to grasp for beginners, but also powerful enough for experts

However, widespread availability of CG tools + increasing number of people using them lead to varying levels of quality.
